This portfolio, available at https://ramrithik.github.io/project_UID/, is a responsive and well-structured website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and background as a front-end web developer. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with clear sections for About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The Projects section displays my work using consistent card layouts with descriptions and links, 
while the Skills section highlights my technical abilities using categorized icons. The Contact section includes a simple form and social links for easy communication. The design emphasizes clean layout,
accessibility, and mobile responsiveness, reflecting my attention to detail and user-focusedÂ approach.
